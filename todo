# Project TODO

> Team of 5 — equal ownership. Everyone contributes and reviews work; split features so load is balanced.

Conventions
- Status: TODO / In Progress / Blocked / Review / Done
- Estimate: small (1–2d) / medium (3–5d) / large (1+ sprint)

## Integration notes
- Use feature branches and open PRs (branch names: feature/<area>)
- Pair-review at least one PR across different members each week
- Owners demo a small scene for integration; others help test and report issues
- Cross-team tasks: write a short spec and pair for the integration step
